## Project Description

I will show you how to create a strong random password using python.

## Rules

The program will force you to follow the rules. You can taste to break the code, but I created infinite loops to make you put the right input.

## Workflow

- I am going to import all the tools that I will use during this project.
- First, I need to create a list that contains all the characters that I want into my password.
- Second, I need to create a function to ask for the length of the password.
- Third, I created a function that generates a password and convert to list to shuffle and after converting again to the string.
- Finally,  I created a main function to show the program.


## Organization

- I created the Trello to plan the project.
- I created the code.
- I created the PowerPoint to present my project.
-- My repository only contains the Readme and the game.
