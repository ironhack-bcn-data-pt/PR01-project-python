## Project Description
My project was about generating a random password.  

## Rules
The rule is that, from a series of string I can generate as many random passwords as I want. 

## Workflow
First, I imported random, then I created various strigs from where the new password can get the digits. Then, I made a funtion where it asks how many password would you like to generate with an input. And If you do not write a number as the answer it makes a loop, and starts all over. 

Finally, I made a while where asks with and input the lenght of the password or passwords. If you do not write a number it makes a loops to te input until you answer with a int.

Then we have a for to print all the data collected.

## Organization
I put all the import at the beginning of the notebook, I made a funtion with a while in it to get how many passwords we are gonna create. Afterwords, we ask the lenght of the passwords.
