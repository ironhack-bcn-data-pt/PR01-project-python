## Project Description 
Hangwomen is a game created with basic python and that interacts with the user.

## Rules

*Standard Rules*

One player thinks of a word; the others try to guess what it is one letter at a time. The player draws a number of dashes equivalent to the number of letters in the word. If a guessing player suggests a letter that occurs in the word, the other player fills in the blanks with that letter in the right places

*Personalized Rules*

- 2 players: PC and Human
- 6 trials to guess the word


## Workflow
1.Prepare the game:

- Generate a random word from a lisr and store it in a variable
- Display length of the secret word 

2.Start the game:

- Ask the player to guess a letter (make sure it is a letter and not a different element o +1 letter)

   -if the guess is correct add to correct_letters 
 
   -if the guess is incorrect increment incorrect_letters and draw the hangwomen 

   -if the incorrect_letter is greater than 6, the game is over 
 
   -if correct_letter is equal to the length of the word, the player wins the game
