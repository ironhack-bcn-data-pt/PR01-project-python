## Project Description

This is the hangman game. I chose this game because I thougt it would be good to practice with strings.

## Rules

In this game, the computer randomly choses a word from a given list. THe player is asked to guess a letter and has 6 attepmts to guess the complete word. Everytime the player says a letter that is not in the word she has to guess, the game shows the image of the hangman with one more item, when she rans out of attemps, she will be shown the complete hangman. For each incorrect letters, she will be shown a list with all the incorrect letters so she doesn't choose them again. 
## Workflow
For this project I started writing pseudocode to plan my code, then I started coding and finally I organised my code with classes. 

## Organization

I used a trello to organize all the steps. In my repository you will find three files:
1) The py file of the game "Hangman" (.py)
2) The notebook file of the game "Hangman" (.ipynb)
3) This readme file with the instructions to play
